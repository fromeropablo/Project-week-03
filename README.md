Everyone likes NBA. The best players are there and the budgets from the franchises are so high compare to the clubs in Europe. Doing some scraping and calling an API, we will be able to find some interesting curiosities about NBA and the Spanish League. If you like basketball, you have found the correct repository. Enjoy!

## Importing libraries and files
Firstly we have to import different packages and a csv file which contains information from every stat recorded. 

For this task we have imported: 

- [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)
- [Os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

### Datasets links
[NBA Stats](https://www.kaggle.com/justinas/nba-players-data)


## What are we gonna study?
  ### 1. What do you wanna select?
An amusing trip to the stats world by basic data. You will have the option to choose which player and which stat from him want to see displayed across the years (1996-97 - currently). 

  ### 2. The Zion Effect.
Zion Williamson arrived to the NBA the last year. Since that moment, the power-forward has increased his impact on the floor. To be aware of that, we will compare his current season with monster seasons from players like 2-times MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James or Kevin Durant. 
  
  ### 3. Who has been cooking at the Spanish League?
A basic analysis of the ACB/Liga Endesa in which we'll find the Top 10 players with the best individual seasons in the 21st Century. Could you guess any of them?
